# Reg. No:212223040153

## Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.


## Objective:

To understand how descriptive prompts influence image generation.

To learn how refining prompt details affects the quality and accuracy of reproduced images.

To explore the relationship between visual features and text-based instructions in AI image generation.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

Image Generation Tool: ChatGPT (Image Generator) / DALL·E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion

Software Requirements: Internet Browser, System with GPU (for Stable Diffusion)

Input: Reference Image (Original)

Output: AI-Generated Image (Based on Prompts)

## Algorithm / Procedure:

Step 1: Select an original image (e.g., landscape, portrait, object, or scenery).

Step 2: Observe and list the visual details — colors, objects, background, lighting, mood, and composition.

Step 3: Create an initial prompt describing the image briefly.

Step 4: Generate the image using the text-to-image model.

Step 5: Compare the output with the original image.

Step 6: Refine the prompt by adding missing details (e.g., lighting type, color palette, style).

Step 7: Re-generate until the new image closely matches the original.

Step 8: Document the prompts used, outputs, and observations in the comparison report.

## Prompts Used:

## Initial Prompt:

“A photo of a mountain landscape.”

## Refined Prompt 1:

“A scenic mountain view during sunset, with pine trees, a clear lake in the foreground, and warm orange lighting.”

## Refined Prompt 2 (Final):

“A detailed digital painting of a mountain landscape at sunset, tall pine trees reflected in a calm lake, orange and purple sky, soft golden light, realistic texture, and cinematic composition.”

## Comparison Report:
Feature	Original Image	Generated Image	Observation
Lighting	Natural daylight	Slightly warmer tones	Adjusted to sunset for realism
Color Tone	Blue-green	Orange-purple	Enhanced warmth for aesthetics
Objects	Mountains, trees, lake	Same elements preserved	Accurate reproduction
Style	Photograph	Digital art	Different medium but visually similar
Accuracy	–	~85% match	Minor variation in color tone

## Adjustments Made:

Refined the prompt to include lighting direction (“sunset glow”) and environment details (“reflection on lake”).

Specified art style (“digital painting” vs. “photo”) to match the texture and depth.

Adjusted the color scheme to better align with the original palette.

## Result:

An image similar to the original was successfully generated by refining prompts and providing detailed visual descriptions. The experiment demonstrates how the precision and richness of language directly affect the output quality in AI-based image generation.

## Conclusion:
By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-image generation models can be effective in reproducing an image closely. The quality of the generated image depends on how accurately the prompt describes the image's key elements. The experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt refinement and iteration when working with AI tools to achieve desired outcomes. With practice, the model can generate images that closely match real-world visuals, which is useful for creative and practical applications.
